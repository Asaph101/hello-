# Hello

Description:It is a website that would cater majorly for developers especially in Moringa and it would mostly use the fundamentals of peek-a-boo project....it would consist of 3 main options on the front page: 
1.(Feel),that would have a list of different moods one can choose from and would later on proceed to interact with content (pictures, quotes and even memes) that are appropriate to the mood chosen by the user. 
2.(Wasted) that would consist of fun facts,memes and GIFS that one can muse over when they have reached ETC{end of thinking capacity},that is during coding. 
3.(Solace) this section would majorly consist of youtube music videos and audios that the user could use to just calm their mind from all the CSS Jquery HTML and so on.
